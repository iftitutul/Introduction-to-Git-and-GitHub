## Branching and Merging

### Creating New Branches
```
cd checks
git branch
git branch <branch name>
git branch
git checkout <branch name>
git branch
```
or, 

```
git checkout -b <branch name>
```

### Working with Branches

Delete branch
```
git branch
git branch -d <branch name>
```

### Merging

```
git branch
# on master branch
git merge <branch name>
```

Git uses two different algorithms to perform a merge, fast-forward and three-way merge. 
- The merge we just performed is an example of a fast-forward merge. This kind of merge occurs when all the commits in the checked out branch are also in the branch that's being merged. If this is the case, we can say that the commit history of both branches doesn't diverge. In these cases, all Git has to do is update the pointers of the branches to the same commit, and no actual merging needs to take place. 
- a three-way merge is performed when the history of the merging branches has diverged in some way, and there isn't a nice linear path to combine them via fast-forwarding. This happens when a commit is made on one branch after the point when both branches split.

### Merge Conflicts 
`git log ---graph -- oneline`

`git merge --abort`
