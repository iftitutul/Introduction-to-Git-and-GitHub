### Undoing Changes Before Committing

`git checkout <filename>`

```
./1.3-all-checks.py > output.txt
git add *
git status
git reset HEAD output.txt
git status
```

### Amending Commits
```
touch file-1.py
touch file-2.py
git add file-1.py
git commit -m "add two files"
git add file-2.py
git commit --amend
```

### Rollbacks
```
code ./1.3-all-checks.py
git commit -a -m "Add disk function"
./1.3-all-checks.py 
## shows error
git revert HEAD
git log -p -2
```

### Identifying a Commit

`git log -1`

The commit ID is the 40 character long string after the word commit, you really can't miss it. This long jumble of letters and numbers is actually something called a hash, which is calculated using an algorithm called SHA1.Essentially, what this algorithm does is take a bunch of data as input and produce a 40 character string from the data as the output. In the case of Git, the input is all information related to the commit, and the 40 character string is the commit ID

## Git Revert Cheat Sheet

[git checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) is effectively used to switch branches.

[git reset](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset#_examples) basically resets the repo, throwing away some changes. It’s somewhat difficult to understand, so reading the examples in the documentation may be a bit more useful.

There are some other useful articles online, which discuss more aggressive approaches to [resetting the repo](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/3-Reset/4-doing-a-hard-reset.html).

[git commit --amend](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert) is used to make changes to commits after-the-fact, which can be useful for making notes about a given commit.

git revert makes a new commit which effectively rolls back a previous commit. It’s a bit like an undo command.

There are a [few ways](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things) you can rollback commits in Git.

There are some interesting considerations about how git object data is stored, such as the usage of sha-1.
