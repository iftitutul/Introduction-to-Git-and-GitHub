## Introduction-to-Git-and-GitHub (GOOGLE)

Git is a VCS created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. The developer who started the Linux kernel.

Git is a free open source system available for installation on Unix based platforms, Windows and macOS. Linus originally created get to help manage the task of developing the Linux kernel. This was difficult because a lot of geographically distributed programmers were collaborating to write a whole bunch of code. Linus had some requirements for the way that the system worked, and its performance that weren't being met by the VCS tools at a time. So he decided to write his own. Git is now one of the most popular version control systems out there and is used in millions of projects. Unlike some version control systems that are centralized around a single server, Git has a distributed architecture. This means that every person contributing to a repository has full copy of the repository on their own development machines.

When looking for information online you might notice that the official Git website is called git-scm.com. And wonder what's the SCM at the end for? It's actually another acronym similar to VCS. It stands for Source Control Management. While both terms mean the same, we generally prefer VCS, because as we call that already, these systems can actually be used to store much more than just source code.
