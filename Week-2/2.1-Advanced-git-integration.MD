## Advanced Git Integration

`git commit -a`

A shorcut to stage any changes to tracked files and commit them in one step

```
git commit -a -m "check file modified"
git log
```
Git uses the head alias to represent the currently checked out snapshot of your project. This lets you know what the contents of your working directory should be. 


`git log -p`

`git show <commit no>`

`git log --stat`

`git diff`

`git add -p`

`git diff --staged`

`git rm <filename>`

```
cat .DS_STORE > .gitignore
git add .gitignore
```

There are many useful git cheatsheets online as well. Please take some time to research and study a few, such as [this one](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

### .gitignore files

.gitignore files are used to tell the git tool to intentionally ignore some files in a given Git repository. For example, this can be useful for configuration files or metadata files that a user may not want to check into the master branch. Check out more at: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore.

A few common examples of file patterns to exclude can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657).
